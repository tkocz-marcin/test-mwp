1# How to use?

You must add add to your project a folder called 'style' and 'js', and include path to file called 'style.css' and 'script.js'.
In the document where you like to use widget, you must crate a div and add class called 'bar'.
In the first line of the 'script.js' you can see: 

var myBar = new MWPjsbar('Add beautiful widgets to your website', 'Get widgets', 'bottom')

You can edit a text of bar, text in the button and choose a position of bar. In brackets you can see 3 string, the first string is a text which will be visible in the bar, second string is a text which will be visible in a button and third string is a position of bar, you can choose a top or bottom.
In the file called 'style.css' you can edit style, for example text color, text size etc.
Remember! 
The string which you edit must be in quotes!
